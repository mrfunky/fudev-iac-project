# Azure Networking Module
## Overview
This module implements a secure and scalable networking foundation for Azure resources. It creates a complete networking infrastructure with proper isolation and security controls.
## Core Features
- Virtual Network with customizable address space
- Subnet segmentation for different workloads
- Automated Network Security Group creation and association
- Service endpoint support for secure Azure service access
- Consistent resource naming with environment prefixes
## Module Components
1. Resource Group
   - Dedicated resource group for networking components
   - Environment-based naming convention
   - Proper resource tagging
2. Virtual Network
   - Configurable address space
   - Environment-specific deployment
   - Tag-based resource management
3. Subnets
   - Dynamic subnet creation based on configuration
   - Service endpoint support
   - Private link endpoint policy enforcement
4. Network Security Groups
   - One NSG per subnet
   - Default deny-all rule for enhanced security
   - Automatic subnet association
## Usage
```hcl
module "network" {
  source = "./modules/networking"
  
  resource_group_name = "<Your-RG-Name>"
  environment        = "dev"
  location           = "eastus"
  
  subnet_configurations = {
    application = {
      address_prefix    = "10.0.1.0/24"
      service_endpoints = ["Microsoft.KeyVault", "Microsoft.Storage"]
    }
    database = {
      address_prefix    = "10.0.2.0/24"
      service_endpoints = ["Microsoft.Sql"]
    }
  }
}
```
## Requirements
- Azure Provider >= 3.0
- Terraform >= 1.0
